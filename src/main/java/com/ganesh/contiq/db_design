A user can upload multiple files at a time. (we can make use of MultipartFile[] to handle it)

search should happen irrespective of file type

when searched and clicked on a doc, it should give the response for each doc as[{

total keyword matches,
[{slide or page number, [paragraph text]}...]
}...]
